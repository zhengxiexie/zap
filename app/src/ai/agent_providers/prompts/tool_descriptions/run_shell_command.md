Executes a given shell command in the user's current shell session.

All commands run in the current working directory by default. The command will be presented to the user for approval before execution unless an auto-approve / allowlist rule applies.

IMPORTANT: This tool is for terminal operations like git, npm, docker, build/test scripts, etc. DO NOT use it for file operations (reading, writing, editing, searching, finding files) — use the specialized tools (`read_files`, `apply_file_diffs`, `grep`, `file_glob`) instead.

# Long-running commands (CRITICAL)

For dev servers, watchers, `tail -f`, interactive REPLs, or any process that does **not exit on its own**, you MUST set `wait_until_complete=false`. Otherwise the current turn will hang forever waiting for the command to terminate.

When `wait_until_complete=false`, the tool returns a `LongRunningCommandSnapshot` with a `command_id`. Use it for follow-ups:
- `read_shell_command_output` — fetch latest stdout
- `write_to_long_running_shell_command` — send stdin / control bytes (for example Ctrl-C to terminate)

For one-shot commands (`ls`, `git status`, `cargo test`, etc.) keep the default `wait_until_complete=true`.

# Approval flags

- `is_read_only=true` — command only reads info (ls/cat/git status/grep/...) and is safe to auto-approve.
- `is_risky=true` — command is destructive (rm -rf, force-push, schema migration, killing processes). Set this so the user gets a more visible confirmation.
- `uses_pager=true` — command may invoke a pager (less/more/git log). Prefer appending `| cat` to avoid blocking.

# Client-enforced restrictions (hard constraints)

These are **not** style suggestions — the client rejects these commands outright and returns an error without executing them. Unlike everything else in this document, violating them WILL fail.

The following categories are rejected:

- **Interactive commands** — `ssh`, `scp`, `mysql`, `psql`, `sudo`, `gpg`, `pass`, `docker`, `kubectl`, `gh`, `aws`, `az`, …
- **Git subcommands that require authentication or touch a remote** — `git push`, `git pull`, `git clone`, `git fetch`, `git remote`, `git lfs`, `git submodule`, …
  Read-only git commands (`git status`, `git log`, `git diff`, `git add`, `git commit`) are **not** affected.
- **Full-screen / TTY programs** — `vim`, `nano`, `less`, `more`, `top`, `htop`, `tmux`, `fzf`, `man`, …
- **Commands that never exit on their own** — `tail`, `journalctl`, `yes`, `sleep`, `ping`, `nc`, `socat`, …

Why: these either wait for input that will never come (the turn hangs), or require a TTY that does not exist here.

What to do instead:

- If a command needs authentication, tell the user to run it manually — for example "please run this in your terminal: `git push`". Do not attempt it yourself.
- If you only need to check state, use a non-interactive alternative (`git status` instead of `git push --dry-run`, `read_files` instead of `cat`).
- If the command genuinely needs to keep running, use `wait_until_complete=false` along with `read_shell_command_output` / `write_to_long_running_shell_command`.

On top of that, any command still exceeding 30 seconds gets terminated automatically, so a stuck command can no longer block the turn forever.

# Quoting and parallelism

- Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes:
  - `mkdir "/Users/name/My Documents"` (correct)
  - `mkdir /Users/name/My Documents` (incorrect — fails)
- When you need to run several independent commands (e.g. `git status` and `git diff`), batch them as multiple parallel `tool_calls` in a single response rather than chaining with `&&`.
- Use `;` only when commands must run sequentially but you don't care if earlier ones fail.
- Avoid `cd <dir> && <cmd>` patterns. The shell session inherits the user's working directory.

# Tools you should NOT shell out to

Avoid using shell with these — use the dedicated tool instead:

| Don't | Use |
|---|---|
| `find`, `ls -R` | `file_glob` |
| `grep`, `rg` | `grep` |
| `cat`, `head`, `tail` | `read_files` |
| `sed`, `awk` | `apply_file_diffs` |
| `echo > file`, `cat <<EOF > file` | `apply_file_diffs` (operation: `create`) |

NEVER use `echo` / `printf` to communicate with the user. Output normal text in your reply instead.

# Git safety

- NEVER run `git config`, `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `git checkout --`, `git rebase -i`, or commit hook bypass flags (`--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`) unless the user explicitly requested them.
- NEVER commit or push unless the user explicitly asked.
- For amends: only amend if the user asked, the previous commit is yours, and it has not been pushed.
- For PRs/commits: when the user asks, gather context first (`git status`, `git diff`, `git log`) in parallel, then craft the message.
